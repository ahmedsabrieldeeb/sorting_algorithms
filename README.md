# sorting_algorithms
This repo is dedicated to practice on sorting algorithms in C.

## Files Ending With *-O
Those files contain the time complexity of each algorithm numbered the same way as each algorithm number	

#### **Format of Files**	
There is one notation per line expressing the big-O complexity of each case
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

> notation format is:	
> - O(1)
> - O(n)
> - O(n!)
> - n square -> O(n^2)
> - log(n) -> O(log(n))
> - n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
> - n + k -> O(n+k)
> - â€¦
